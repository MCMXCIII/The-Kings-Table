Looking for a late night diner where you can ger , a nice glass of whisky some breakfast food with your drink and a beautiful rooftop to enjoy after your meal.

The Crimson is the place for you. Nestled in the heart of chinatown conjoined with a famous micro hotel "The Pod" (Which I will have a review for soon) Sits the Crimson with a beautiful decor and is very athestically pleasing lively staff and overall friendly vibe. The first floor is the diner and makes breakfast all day long and also makes drinks all day long.

## First Floor Bar
Lined with booths adjacent to the bar and some booths in the back giving you that old classic diner feel. The bar here list most if not all of the bar classics you can find in most bars and the bartenders can make most drinks here with ease. the prices are decent here for the cost of alcohol in general. I usually judge the average places pricing by ordering classic easy cocktails my go to is and Old Fashioned and based on the price of this cocktail I base my price rating.
Given that an Glass of whisky(Old Fashioned) is 10 bucks even and about average for most places in the in a populated and dense area I would say that prices are decently price for the area. They is also a happy hour menu which has a cool collection of drink and house signature drinks. The pair pretty nice with the regular types of bar food, the Crimson's signature bar food go to are the onion rings which can be paired with most happy hour drinks.

Also additions can be added on to most dirnks for free for the most part and the staff would be glad to oblige you. Substitutions and variation on classic drinks. Overall a good place to crash after work by the looks of the crowd that comes here duting the typically happy hours.

The King's Table gives the Crimson's First floor bar 4/5.

## Downstairs:The Whisky Bar
Taking a trip downstairs you can see the dimmly lit speakeasy feel of a lounge. Welcome to the Crimson's Whisky bar. Right below the diner and the with over 300 different types of whisky and their menu is pretty impressive and the menu of the whiksy bar is very similar to the menu of the bar upstairs with some just some small bites that come from the kitchen upstairs but it's mostly the same menu. What makes this whisky bar diffent than other's is the lounge like setting with alot circular booths and an open area for performers, DJs and singers. Which makes The Crimson a pretty good and popular venue with local talent and in some cases some mainstream talent. With an island style and semi open floor plan with the good layout makes it pretty easy to get in and out of the basement which is rare for bars like this. Overall if you are looking to relax with a nice drink and maybe bring a lady friend or just bring your friends or have a large party the whisky bar in the basement is the place for you.

The King's Table give's The Crimson's whisky bar a 3.5/5
